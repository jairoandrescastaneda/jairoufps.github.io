This year the increment the students in canada is incredible, between 60% and 80% with respect to the last year,
we outside to the streets and made different questions to students, with the objective to recollect data, we build the follow question with multiple options to response:
why students choose canada to study english in canada?, the result are  very interested

We ask 1000 students two question with multiple options, the question was, what is the vantages and advantages to study in canada, we get the four
options that more repeated in the two question, and the result we present  the result in next paragraph

In the first question the 20% of students response that canada is a beautiful country, and they can visit a different places
while they are in the school, the next 20% response for the utc zone, because for the sur-americans this is very similar,
the other 50% response that canada has a good security life, for example canada has a low criminality, and finally the 10%
response that canada is a good place to have mascots, like dogs and cats

The other hand in the disadvantages the student response in the next side, the 20% say that canada is very expansible,
because the cost of life is high, and the next 50% say that canada has temp extremely, the next 20% say the process to study in canada
is very difficult, and finally the 10% say that canada has more taxes

For the conclusion  i think the canada is a beautiful place to study and live, but the cost of life is a little bit life for
sur-americans
